/**
 * The HTTP doors, as one function: `answer` takes a request and returns a
 * status and a body, or `null` for "not ours, let Vite have it". `doors()` in
 * vite.config.ts is the only thing that touches a socket, which is what lets
 * the tests call this directly.
 *
 * Almost everything this module does happens on the socket in `live.ts`.
 * What is here is what the page needs to know BEFORE it opens one — which
 * sessions this place has, whether the program is installed — and the two
 * things a person can do to a session that are not typing into it.
 *
 * ## Reads carry the ticket too
 *
 * `GET /api/place` says what somebody has been working on: the first line of
 * each session's first prompt, and when. Terminal deleted the one door it had
 * like that (`/api/chats`) and was right to. This one is needed — it is the
 * list the person chooses from — so it is fenced the way a write is: the
 * ticket this process printed into its own page. The MCP door says the same
 * things to an agent without one, because an agent has no page to have been
 * handed a ticket by; what fences that is what fences every module's MCP
 * door, the loopback bind and the absence of any CORS header.
 *
 * ## Nothing here starts anything
 *
 * A session is started by the socket's first frame, from the page, and the
 * installer by a press in the page. No door below runs a program, and the MCP
 * door has one tool, which reads.
 *
 * ## One door is not the page's
 *
 * `POST /api/state` is where a session's own program says what it is doing
 * (see "Told, not read" in live.ts). It carries no page ticket and is not
 * asked for one: what it must carry is the secret of the one session it
 * speaks for, in the same header. It answers 204 to a report it took and 403
 * to everything else — a wrong secret, no secret, a session that is not
 * running — in one sentence that does not say which. It reads no body, and
 * nothing in a report is stored or shown.

 * Every change of a running session's state (an unnamed event), and — for a
 * page that says a host is framing it — the notices raised for a person who
 * is not looking (`notice`), which only a framed page can pass on, and the whole
 * activity list (`activity`: on arrival and on every change) that the page hands to
 * the host as `activity.set`. The page
 * opens it instead of asking on a clock.
 *
 * Ticketed like the read it sits beside, since a notice carries a session's
 * label. An `EventSource` cannot send a header, so the ticket is in the
 * query; the address is this module's own origin and is asked by its own
 * page, and nothing logs it.
