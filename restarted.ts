/**
 * A session that outlived a restart of Kehikot (or of this module) and the tools it lost.
 *
 * When Kehikot restarts, the host and every module go away for a while. A session that keeps
 * running has its MCP servers drop, and OpenCode does not connect a remote server again once its
 * connection failed or closed (v1.19.5 `mcp/index.ts`; 2.x reconnects in place only when the server
 * says the session expired): the tools are gone until the person retries them in `/mcps`
 * (`RECONNECT` in context.ts). The sessions this module holds end with it (`endAll` in live.ts) and
 * come back as new processes with their servers connected afresh: this is for one that outlived it,
 * or the host restarting under a module that stayed. An agent that no longer sees
 * `queue_run` tends to run the heavy command itself. So at the session's first prompt after this
 * module started again, it is told once (`restartNote`): the tools may be gone, and the shell path
 * that does the same — Queue's CLI, which finds Queue wherever it came back — and how the person
 * brings them back where the CLI has a way.
 *
 * "Since its last prompt" is a marker beside what the session was told (`restartedSince`): this
 * process's start, written at every prompt. Another start's marker means this module restarted in
 * between, and so its door, and Kehikot's, were away.
