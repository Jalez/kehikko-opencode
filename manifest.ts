/**
 * What this app says about itself when a host asks.
 *
 * ## What it is
 *
 * A terminal with one program in it: the Codex CLI session that belongs to the place the person is
 * looking at. The sibling of the Claude module (`kehikot.claude`), with the same promises: a
 * session belongs to the epic, the parts picked out of it and the kehikko, and moves when any of
 * them does.
 *
 * ## What is declared
 *
 * - **`reacts: ['parts']`**, **`scope: 'kehikko'`** (2.29.0): a session is kept for a place — this
 *   kehikko, the open epic and its picked parts.
 * - **`uses: ['activity:report']`** (1.5.0): the whole list of its sessions' states, for the Inbox;
 *   **`uses: ['events:emit']`, `emits: [NOTICES]`** for a host that does not answer the list.
 * - **`agentSessions: { loadsSkills: true, installsSkills: true }`** (2.21.0, 2.23.0): it runs
 *   agent sessions and loads the kehikko-bound skills of the modules on a session's kehikko into
 *   them, and it installs skills itself, where Codex reads them (`~/.agents/skills`, agentSkills.ts):
 *   Codex has no folder for one process. A host routes the kehikko-bound skills here, tells it which
 *   skills it keeps for every conversation (`everywhere`), and installs none of this module's own
 *   skills for Claude Code.
 * - **`skills`**: its own `$kehikot-here`, written for Codex (doors.ts adds the list, whose versions
 *   follow the origin it serves on).
 * - **`mcp.as: 'kehikko-codex'`**: the id would derive `codex`, the name of the program an agent
 *   is likely to be, and a door called that reads as the agent's own.
 * - **`prompt: false`**: nothing here sends a prompt to anything. The person types.
 * - **`storage: true`**: the page opens a WebSocket to its own origin.
 * - **An MCP door with one tool that reads**: which sessions belong to which place.
 * - **`settings`** (2.15.0): resuming conversations a restart cut off, the model, its effort and
 *   when Codex asks before acting — each a person's (settings.ts).
