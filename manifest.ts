/**
 * What this app says about itself when a host asks.
 *
 * ## What it is
 *
 * A terminal with one program in it: the OpenCode session (the `opencode` TUI) that belongs to the
 * place the person is looking at. The sibling of the Claude and Codex modules (`kehikot.claude`,
 * `kehikot.codex`), with the same promises: a session belongs to the epic, the parts picked out of
 * it and the kehikko, and moves when any of them does.
 *
 * ## What is declared
 *
 * - **`reacts: ['parts']`**, **`scope: 'kehikko'`** (2.29.0): a session is kept for a place — this
 *   kehikko, the open epic and its picked parts.
 * - **`uses: ['activity:report']`** (1.5.0): the whole list of its sessions' states, for the Inbox;
 *   **`uses: ['events:emit']`, `emits: [NOTICES]`** for a host that does not answer the list.
 * - **`uses: ['view:expand']`** (protocol 2.58.0): in a container too small for a terminal the page
 *   is a tile, and pressing it asks the host to show the container large over the canvas. A host
 *   that does not answer the method is not asked: the tile shows the conversation in place.
 * - **`uses: ['agents:message']`** (protocol 2.41.0): `send_message` and `read_messages` on its door, a thin
 *   adapter over the host's messages between agent sessions, and a session's unread ones in its notes.
 *   A host before 2.41.0 keeps none: the door lists neither tool and the notes say nothing.
 * - **`agentSessions: { loadsSkills: true, installsSkills: true }`** (2.21.0, 2.23.0): it runs
 *   agent sessions and loads the kehikko-bound skills of the modules on a session's kehikko into
 *   them, and it gives its sessions skills itself, where OpenCode reads them: the session's own
 *   configuration folder (`OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR`, skills.ts). A host routes the kehikko-bound skills
 *   here, tells it which skills it keeps for every conversation (`everywhere`), and installs none of
 *   this module's own skills (written for OpenCode) for Claude Code.
 * - **`skills`**: its own `/kehikot-here`, written for OpenCode (doors.ts adds the list, whose versions
 *   follow the origin it serves on).
 * - **`mcp.as: 'kehikko-opencode'`**: the id would derive `opencode`, the name of the program an
 *   agent is likely to be, and a door called that reads as the agent's own.
 * - **`prompt: false`**: nothing here sends a prompt to anything. The person types.
 * - **`storage: true`**: the page opens a WebSocket to its own origin.
 * - **An MCP door with one tool that reads**: which sessions belong to which place.
 * - **`settings`** (2.15.0): resuming conversations a restart cut off, the model, the agent and
 *   when OpenCode asks before acting — each a person's (settings.ts).
