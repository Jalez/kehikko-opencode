# Codex

A terminal holding the Codex CLI session that belongs to the place you are looking at.

Port **8100**. `kehikot.codex`. The sibling of the Claude module (`kehikot.claude`): the same
record, page, doors and promises, with `program.ts` answering for OpenAI's Codex CLI instead of
Claude Code. Everything here was measured against Codex CLI **0.164.0** with a scratch
`CODEX_HOME` and a stand-in for the model API; no account was used.

```bash
bun install
./run.sh             # or: PORT=8100 ./run.sh
```

Then put it on a kehikko. Opened on its own (<http://127.0.0.1:8100/app>) it says nothing is
framing it: a session belongs to a project, and only a host says which.

---

## What it does

- **A session per place.** A place is project + epic + the picked parts + kehikko. Opening the
  module there shows Codex's own UI in a terminal: the place's conversation, resumed by id
  (`codex resume <id>`), or a new one. The View menu lists this kehikko's conversations; Codex's
  own `/resume` and `/clear` work in it, and the record follows (the session's own hooks name the
  conversation it is on).
- **Disconnect and connect again.** The View menu has "Connected to this kehikko", a checkbox for the
  conversation on screen; unchecking it (or the Run menu's "Disconnect from this kehikko") takes it off
  this kehikko. It is kept, not ended, and a line says where to connect it again: the Go menu's "Connect
  a conversation to this kehikko" lists the project's conversations that belong to no place. Not
  confirmed (it can be undone), and no agent may press any of these.
- **Filed with no command.** A conversation started here is filed under its place the moment
  Codex has a record of it (its first prompt) and is that kehikko's own when the kehikko had none.
  `$kehikot-here`, typed in a Codex conversation, assigns that conversation to the kehikko on
  screen.
- **It knows where it is.** At its start — new, resumed, cleared or compacted — a session is told
  its place, one line per module on the kehikko (name, door, what it says to agents — its
  `agentSays`, else its summary — and its skills), the modules installed on this computer but not on
  this kehikko that say something there (`absentSays`, official modules only), and the skills
  Kehikot installed for it, each a `$name` it can call; at a prompt it is told only what changed (a
  module put on the kehikko or taken off, one newly absent, or the conversation moved). The notes
  are the protocol's (`sessionNotes`), word for word what a Claude conversation on the same kehikko
  is told; this module delivers them through Codex's `SessionStart` and `UserPromptSubmit` hooks
  (`additionalContext`, a developer message). *What this conversation was told* in the View menu
  shows the person those notes, as plain text.
- **The kehikko's MCP doors** — the host's own and each module's, each carrying the
  conversation's place token — are given to the session for that one process.
- **Skills, in Codex's `$` menu.** `$kehikot-here`, the skills of every module on the kehikko
  (kehikko-bound ones only when what they need is there), and — when Kehikot › Settings keeps
  every module's skills installed — Kehikot's own and every module's, translated into Codex's
  skill format and installed in `~/.agents/skills`, where Codex reads them (`agentSkills.ts`).
  Only folders carrying Kehikot's marker are written or removed; a skill of the person's by that
  name is left alone and the session is told so. A session holds what it was given until it ends;
  what nothing holds and Settings do not keep is removed. Every Kehikot install a session is not
  given (another kehikko's kehikko-bound skill) is switched off for that one process
  (`-c skills.config`). The manifest says `agentSessions: { loadsSkills: true, installsSkills:
  true }` (protocol 2.23.0): the host routes kehikko-bound skills here, says which skills it keeps
  for every conversation, and installs none of this module's own for Claude Code.
- **Working, needs you, finished**, from Codex's own hooks, in the Inbox (`activity.set`) and the
  View menu; a notice when a session nobody is looking at needs its person or finishes. "Needs you"
  in the Inbox is a question Codex put up in a conversation that has had a turn, which the person
  has not had on screen since: never an empty conversation at its prompt, and the line goes when it
  is answered, opened or ended (`needsYou` in live.ts, the same rule as the Claude module's).
- **Interrupted work.** A conversation a restart cut off mid-turn is a "needs you" line in the
  Inbox, and — unless "Resume conversations cut off by a restart" is off — is told what happened
  when its place is next opened.
- **The context meter** under the session: the window in use, from the transcript, with
  **Compact** (`/compact`) and **Clear** (`/clear`) typed only on a person's press, only while
  Codex waits at its prompt.
- **Settings** (Kehikot › Settings, or the gear on the container): resume conversations cut off
  by a restart; the model; the reasoning effort; when Codex asks before acting. Each a person's.
- **`sessions`**, an MCP tool that reads: which sessions belong to which place, their state and
  their context.

## What Codex supports, as found

Found by reading `codex --help`, `codex features list`, the docs at developers.openai.com (now
learn.chatgpt.com) and the source of openai/codex at `970111f`, and by running the CLI in a pty
against a stand-in for the Responses API.

| | Codex CLI 0.164.0 |
|---|---|
| **Where it lives** | Not on this machine's PATH. npm (`@openai/codex`: a Node launcher, `bin/codex.js`, in front of a Rust binary in `@openai/codex-<platform>/vendor/<triple>/bin/codex`), Homebrew cask, or inside the Codex desktop app. The module's Install button never needs admin rights: `brew install --cask codex` when Homebrew is here, otherwise `npm install -g --prefix ~/.local @openai/codex` (the plain `npm install -g` fails with EACCES where npm's prefix is root-owned, e.g. `/usr/local`); it runs in a terminal the person watches, and a failure is said in a sentence with the full output behind "See the log". `find` looks in PATH, `~/.local/bin`, `/opt/homebrew/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`, `~/.npm-global/bin`, `~/.bun/bin`, npm's own global prefix (`npm prefix -g`) and `Codex.app/Contents/Resources`, and runs the Rust binary behind an npm launcher directly, so no `node` has to be on the desktop app's thin PATH. |
| **Per-run configuration** | `-c key=value` (TOML values) layers a "session flags" config over `~/.codex/config.toml` without writing it. A dotted key cannot hold a dot, so a table whose keys have dots is given whole (`-c hooks.state={…}`). Any `-c` puts the session in *embedded mode*: it runs in the CLI's own process, not on Codex's shared background server. |
| **MCP** | `[mcp_servers.<name>]` in config.toml, `codex mcp add`, or per run `-c mcp_servers.<name>={url="…"}` (streamable HTTP). Measured: a per-run server connects and `/mcp` lists it beside the person's own. |
| **Skills** | Measured: a skill in `~/.agents/skills` is in the `$` menu and runs; `-c skills.config=[{path=…,enabled=false}]` switches one off for one process and is added to the person's own entries; the list is read when a session starts. A folder with `SKILL.md`: `name` and `description` front matter (the open agent-skills format, the same as Claude Code's); optional `agents/openai.yaml` (`policy.allow_implicit_invocation: false`). Found in `$CODEX_HOME/skills` (deprecated), `~/.agents/skills`, `<repo>/.agents/skills` up to the repo root, `/etc/codex/skills`, plugins and the bundled ones. **No per-run skill folder**: no `--plugin-dir`; `skills.config` only enables or disables a skill already found. No `$ARGUMENTS`, no `${…SESSION_ID}` substitution, no load-time `` !`command` `` lines. Invoked with `$name` or by matching its description. |
| **Hooks** | Claude Code's events and JSON nearly one for one: `SessionStart` (`source`: startup, resume, clear, compact), `UserPromptSubmit`, `PreToolUse`, `PermissionRequest`, `PostToolUse`, `Stop`, `Interrupt`, `PreCompact`, `PostCompact`, `SubagentStart/Stop`, `SessionEnd`. Each is handed `session_id`, `transcript_path`, `cwd`. `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` from SessionStart and UserPromptSubmit reaches the model as a developer message. **Non-managed hooks need trust**: `hooks.state."<source>:<event>:<group>:<handler>".trusted_hash` must equal the hook's hash (sha256 of its normalised definition), else Codex asks the person to review them. Measured: the hash can be given per run in `-c hooks.state`, which trusts exactly this module's hooks for one process. |
| **Sessions** | `codex` (a new one: Codex chooses a UUIDv7 id, and writes nothing until the first prompt), `codex resume <id> [prompt]`, `codex fork`, `codex archive`. Transcripts at `$CODEX_HOME/sessions/YYYY/MM/DD/rollout-<time>-<id>.jsonl`; `$CODEX_HOME/thread-writer-locks/<id>.lock` is held open by the process writing a conversation, and a second `resume` of a held one says "open in another app" and offers retry or fork. `codex exec` is the non-interactive mode. `codex agents` is a TUI over the background server, with no JSON. |
| **Notify / status line** | `notify = [cmd]` runs on a turn's end with a JSON argument (the hooks cover it and more). `tui.status_line` is a list of built-in footer items, not a command: there is no status line to read the live figures from. |
| **Compact / Clear** | `/compact`, and `/clear` (clears the terminal and starts a new chat; `/new` does the same without clearing). |
| **Tokens** | Every request writes an `event_msg` `token_count`: `last_token_usage` (`input_tokens`, `cached_input_tokens`, `cache_write_input_tokens`, `output_tokens`, `reasoning_output_tokens`, `total_tokens`) and `model_context_window` (the usable window: 258 400 of gpt-5.5's 272 000). `total_tokens` of the last request is what Codex calls the tokens in the window. A compaction is a `compacted` row followed by a fresh `token_count`. Codex compacts by itself at 90 % of the whole window unless `model_auto_compact_token_limit` says less. No cost is written. |
| **Environment** | `CODEX_THREAD_ID` is the conversation's id in every command Codex runs. The default sandbox (workspace-write) blocks network, loopback included: a command that talks to Kehikot must ask to run outside it. |

## The Claude module, feature by feature

| Claude 1.8 | Codex 0.1 | |
|---|---|---|
| Terminal sessions in the container, several, a reload reconnects to the same screen | **done** | the same server-owned runs and headless screen; Bun's pty when ready-built, node-pty under Vite |
| Sessions filed per place, auto-assigned, the kehikko's own | **done** | filed when Codex's first hook names the conversation (Codex chooses the id) |
| Resume after restarts and updates | **adapted** | resumed by id when the place is next opened. A conversation does **not** keep running through a restart: per-run settings put Codex in embedded mode, so it ends with the module (Claude's run in Claude Code's background and are re-attached) |
| A conversation open in another process | **adapted** | asked of the lock file (`lsof`); "Open it here anyway" lets Codex itself offer retry or fork. No attach: Codex has no attachable background session |
| Kehikot's MCP doors per session | **done** | `-c mcp_servers.<name>=…` per run. The place token is in the process's arguments: Codex reads per-run servers from nowhere else that is not `~/.codex` (the token is a pointer, not a credential) |
| Skills loaded per session, kehikko-bound by `needs` | **adapted** | Codex has no per-run skill folder, so the skills are installed in `~/.agents/skills` while a session holds them, and are in Codex's `$` menu. Every Kehikot install a session is not given is switched off for its process (`-c skills.config=[{path=…,enabled=false}]`). A kehikko-bound skill also checks its place first, for a Codex conversation started outside Kehikot while it is installed. Claude Code skill syntax is translated (`forCodex`) |
| `/kehikot-here` | **adapted** | `$kehikot-here`: the model runs one `curl` with `$CODEX_THREAD_ID`, outside the sandbox, which the person approves. Declared in the manifest with `installsSkills`, so a host installs it for Codex through this module (kept in `~/.agents/skills` for every conversation when Settings keep every module's skills), never for Claude Code |
| Context at start and changes at the next prompt | **done** | the same `context.sh`, and the same words (the protocol's `sessionNotes`); SessionStart comes at a new conversation's first prompt |
| What this conversation was told | **done** | the same View item and panel |
| Working / needs you / finished, notices, Inbox | **done** | Codex's hooks, trusted per run by hash. Better than Claude's on two points: an Esc interrupt is reported (`Interrupt`), and Codex's question tool (`request_user_input`, by a `PreToolUse` matcher; measured with the stand-in CLI only) is "needs you". Codex runs `PermissionRequest` hooks just before it draws the question |
| Interrupted-work alert after a restart | **adapted** | the cut-off turn is the Inbox line, and the conversation is told on its next open (Claude wakes it in the background at once). Codex writes nothing about background terminals a session's end killed, so there are no "background tasks didn't finish" lines |
| Context meter | **done** | from `token_count`; exact window from Codex itself. No cost (Codex writes none), no live status line (Codex has no status-line command) |
| Compact and Clear | **done** | `/compact`, `/clear`, on a press, only at the prompt |
| Settings | **done, more** | resume after a restart, model, reasoning effort, approvals (`on-request` / `never`); never the sandbox |
| `sessions` MCP tool | **done** | |
| Ready-built, run.sh stamp check | **done** | |
| Icon | **adapted** | `lucide:bot`: the protocol has no OpenAI mark (`BRAND_MODULE_ICONS`) |
| "Report sessions started outside Kehikot" (a SessionStart hook in the person's settings) | **not done** | it would write into `~/.codex/config.toml`, and a hook there needs the person's trust in Codex's own `/hooks` screen |
| Session names in the agent's lists (`--name`) | **not possible** | Codex takes no name at start (`/rename` is typed in the session) |

## Where its data lives

`<project>/.kehikot/codex/places.json` (which session belongs to which place; ignored by git by
default, with a `.gitignore` beside it) and `<project>/.kehikot/codex/settings.json`. Nothing in
`~/.codex` is written; Codex's own records there are read (`sessions/`, `thread-writer-locks/`).
A session's folder (its context hook, its token and the list of its skills, 0700/0600) is in this
user's temporary directory, under `kehikot-codex-<uid>/`, and is removed when the session ends.
Kehikot's skills for Codex are in `~/.agents/skills/<name>/`, each with a `.kehikot-skill.json`
marker (who installed it, which module offers it, each file's sha256, the sessions holding it, and
whether Settings keep it for every conversation).

## What it never does

- It never sends a prompt of anybody's. Its one sentence — "Kehikot restarted while you were
  working…" — goes, once, to a conversation a restart cut off, when its place is next opened,
  behind the person's setting; and `/compact` or `/clear`, on a person's press.
- It never widens what Codex may do: no `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`, no
  `--approve-for-me`, no `--dangerously-bypass-hook-trust` (which would run the person's own
  untrusted hooks too), no sandbox setting. The approvals setting can only make Codex ask, or
  make a command that would leave the sandbox fail.
- It never writes `~/.codex/config.toml`, a profile, a plugin or a skill there. In
  `~/.agents/skills` it writes and removes only folders carrying its own marker, and never one the
  person changed.
- It never reads what a hook is handed beyond the conversation's id, and never reads a transcript
  beyond what labels a session (what the person typed first and last), the turn markers and the
  token counts.

## Doors

The Claude module's doors, the same paths (`/app`, `/healthz`, `WS /session`, `/api/place`,
`/api/rekey`, `/api/end`, `/api/settings`, `/api/kehikot/settings`, `/api/restart`,
`/api/assign`, `/api/detach`, `/api/showing`, `/api/context`, `/api/state`, `/api/here`,
`/api/feed`, `/mcp`, `/kehikot/skills/kehikot-here.md`), less `/api/status` (no status line) and
`/api/hook`. `/api/state` takes `thread`, the conversation Codex says the hook ran in.

## Layout

| file | what is in it |
|---|---|
| `program.ts` | everything that knows it is Codex: where it is, what it can do, its records, its hooks and their trust, its locks |
| `skills.ts`, `plugin/skills/kehikot-here` | the skills a session is given, in Codex's format, and the translation from Claude Code's |
| `agentSkills.ts` | installing them in `~/.agents/skills`: the marker, who holds what, removal, switching off per process |
| `meter.ts`, `gauges.ts` | the context meter, from `token_count` rows read as the transcript grows |
| `cutoff.ts` | a turn cut off, and whether the person moved on |
| `settings.ts` | the settings, and the `-c` arguments they become |
| `doorConfig.ts` | the doors the host gives a session, as `-c mcp_servers.*` |
| `live.ts`, `record.ts`, `context.ts`, `here.ts`, `doors.ts`, `place.ts`, `input.ts`, `src/` | as in the Claude module |
| `tell.sh`, `context.sh` | what a session's hooks run |
| `test/stand-in/codex` | a Bun stand-in for the CLI: it refuses a hook whose trust hash does not match, as Codex does |

## Checks

```bash
bun test
bun run typecheck
```

The tests give themselves a machine of their own (`test/setup.ts`): a scratch home,
`CODEX_HOME`, registry and PATH.

By hand, end to end in scratch with the real Codex CLI and a stand-in model API (no account):
`HOST_DIR=<host worktree> CODEX_BIN=<folder with codex> bun dev/e2e/skills.ts` — the skills in
Codex's `$` menu, `$kehikot-here` run, a kehikko-bound skill off on another kehikko and removed
when its session ends.

## Served ready-built

`run.sh` serves the built page (`serve.ts`, the protocol's `run`) when `dist/` carries a stamp of
the commit checked out, and Vite otherwise. `bun run build` makes the build and the stamp; a host
runs it when it installs or updates the module, never at start.
