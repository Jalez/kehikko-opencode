/**
 * One view of one run: xterm in the page, and a socket to the session the
 * server is holding.
 *
 * It is Terminal's `terminal-view.tsx` with one thing turned round. There,
 * the view OWNS the shell: unmounting it closes the socket and the pty dies.
 * Here the view is a viewer. The session belongs to the server (`live.ts`);
 * this attaches to it, is sent the screen as it stands, and follows along.
 * Unmounting closes the socket and nothing else — which is what lets a page
 * reload, a place switched away from, or a view let go to keep the page
 * light all leave an agent exactly where it was.
 *
 * What came over unchanged, each for the reason Terminal found the hard way
 * (its file has the essays): nothing is opened until the container has a real
 * width; a container with no size is not a container two columns wide; what
 * is typed before the socket opens is kept and flushed in order rather than
 * dropped; a keystroke can be what connects.
 *
 * ## Two kinds of frame, and why
 *
 * What the program prints arrives as BINARY and is written to the emulator
 * unread. What this module's server says to its own page — which session
 * this is, what it is called — arrives as TEXT. The kind of the frame is the
 * envelope, so nothing a program prints can be read as the second.
