/**
 * The conversations connected to the kehikko on screen, said in two places:
 * a bar on the page when there are none, and a View menu in the container's
 * header when there are.
 *
 * ## Connected
 *
 * A conversation is connected to a kehikko (strictly: to its place — the
 * epic, the picked parts and the kehikko) when the record lists it there
 * (`places.json`). Exactly two things put it there, and neither is a guess:
 *
 *  - `$kehikot-here`, typed by the person in that conversation;
 *  - it is the conversation this container itself started (or moved on to,
 *    by `/resume` or `/clear` in it) — written once Codex has a record
 *    of it, which is when the person first says something in it.
 *
 * Nothing else connects one: no conversation of the project is offered or
 * picked here, and none started elsewhere is filed under a kehikko because
 * it happens to be running in the same folder.
 *
 * ## The bar
 *
 * With none connected the container still shows Codex — a fresh
 * conversation in the project's folder — and one slim line above it says
 * that nothing is connected and how to connect one (`NONE_CONNECTED`), with
 * the command to copy. It is not an Inbox item: it is about this container,
 * and is gone the moment the record lists one.
 *
 * ## The View menu
 *
 * A `switch` (protocol 1.1.0, `kehikot.header`): every conversation
 * connected here, the kehikko's own first, each with what it is doing, how
 * full its context window is, when it was last active and whether it is the
 * own one. Choosing one resumes it
 * in the container. For the one on screen go: "Make this the kehikko's own" (a run, when it is not),
 * "Connected to this kehikko" (a toggle, so in the View menu: unchecking disconnects) and "Disconnect
 * from this kehikko" (a run). The protocol draws a switch's options as plain choices, so there is no
 * per-row action: the one on screen is the one acted on, and choosing another row is one press.
 * A disconnected conversation is kept; "Connect a conversation to this kehikko" (a jump, so in the Go
 * menu) lists the project's conversations that belong to no place and connects the one chosen. No
 * agent may press any of these. The host draws them and lays them out at every width.
