/**
 * The conversations connected to the kehikko on screen, said in two places:
 * a bar on the page when there are none, and a View menu in the container's
 * header when there are.
 *
 * ## Connected
 *
 * A conversation is connected to a kehikko (strictly: to its place — the
 * epic, the picked parts and the kehikko) when the record lists it there
 * (`places.json`). Exactly two things put it there, and neither is a guess:
 *
 *  - `/kehikot-here`, typed by the person in that conversation;
 *  - it is the conversation this container itself started (or moved on to,
 *    by `/resume` or `/clear` in it) — written once OpenCode has a record
 *    of it, which is when the person first says something in it.
 *
 * Nothing else connects one: no conversation of the project is offered or
 * picked here, and none started elsewhere is filed under a kehikko because
 * it happens to be running in the same folder.
 *
 * ## The bar
 *
 * With none connected the container still shows OpenCode — a fresh
 * conversation in the project's folder, started by this module, at any size
 * (behind the tile too) — and one slim line above it. While that new one is
 * on screen the line says it becomes this kehikko's own once spoken to, and
 * that the command is for one started elsewhere (`STARTED_HERE`): nobody types
 * it for a conversation this module started. With nothing of this module's on
 * screen it says nothing is connected and how to connect one
 * (`NONE_CONNECTED`). Both carry the command to copy. It is not an Inbox item:
 * it is about this container, and is gone the moment the record lists one.
 *
 * ## The conversation chooser
 *
 * One `switch` in the header's View menu (protocol 1.1.0, `kehikot.header`), labelled with the
 * conversation on screen — "Conversation: Fix login bug" — because choosing which conversation the
 * container shows is a choice of what the module shows, not a jump. Its options (protocol 2.68.0,
 * an option's `group` and `detail`):
 *
 *  - under "This kehikko’s conversation", the place's own;
 *  - under "Other conversations here", every other conversation connected to this place, the most
 *    recently active first;
 *  - each with its title as the label and, as its second line, what it is doing in words (working,
 *    needs you, finished, idle), when it was last active, and "(running elsewhere)" when another
 *    process has it;
 *  - then "New conversation" (a fresh one here; not while a new one is already on screen) and
 *    "Disconnect this conversation" (for one on screen that is connected here; unconfirmed: it is
 *    kept, and typing the command in it connects it again).
 *
 * Nothing from another place is ever listed, and nothing that belongs to no place: a conversation
 * started elsewhere is connected by typing the command in it. A host before 2.68.0 draws the label
 * alone: the titles, without headings or second lines. Beside the chooser, in Run: "Make this the
 * kehikko’s own" (when the one on screen is connected and not the own) and "What this conversation
 * was told". There is no Go menu: nothing here is a jump. No agent may press any of these. The host
 * draws them and lays them out at every width.
