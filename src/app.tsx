/**
 * The session for the place the canvas is about, on screen.
 *
 * Separate from `App` so that it can be rendered in a test with the canvas's
 * answer handed in as a prop. What it decides is in `view/places.ts`; this
 * holds the state and draws it.
 *
 * ## Every view stays mounted, and it matters less than it does in Terminal
 *
 * Views not on screen are `hidden`, so coming back to a place is instant and
 * its scrollback is exactly as it was. But a view here is only a viewer: the
 * session is the server's. Letting one go — to keep the page to `MOST_VIEWS`
 * emulators, or because the page reloaded — ends nothing, and the next view
 * of that session is sent its screen.
 *
 * ## A place opens its session, and nothing stands in the way
 *
 * There is no number of running sessions at which a place is refused, and
 * so no list a person is made to end something from. A session left waiting
 * behind another view for a long time has its process put away by the server
 * (`QUIET_REST` in live.ts); its view here is told so, is let go without a
 * word, and coming back to the place resumes the same session.
 *
 * ## Codex's own UI, always
 *
 * There is no list of the project's conversations to pick from: the place
 * opens one of its connected conversations, or a new one when it has none
 * (`decide` in view/places.ts). Choosing among the connected ones is the
 * header's View menu; starting another is Codex's own `/clear`, and
 * going to an older one its own `/resume`, both in the terminal.
 *
 * One question is still put before anything is started, in the terminal's
 * own space: a session another Codex process has open, and that cannot
 * be attached to, is not resumed. The server says who has it and closes the
 * socket (`ELSEWHERE`), and the person chooses between leaving it and opening
 * a copy, with what a copy means beside the word. While that stands for a
 * place, nothing is opened there by itself (`blocked`). A session Codex
 * Code runs in the background needs no question: the server attaches to it.
 *
 * ## What is drawn besides the terminal
 *
 * One slim bar above it while no conversation is connected to this kehikko
 * (`view/bar.tsx`), saying so and what to type where. Nothing else costs a
 * row while a session is running. A strip appears along the bottom only when
 * there is nothing running to take the space from: the session has ended,
 * the install did not finish, or this module's server has gone.
 *
 * ## What a session is doing, and what is done about it
 *
 * Its program says — working, needs you, finished (`State` in program.ts) —
 * and the page is told as it changes, on the view's own socket and, for the
 * sessions it has no view of, on one feed (`api.feed`). It is drawn as one
 * glyph before its title in the header's View menu, and adds no row, line or
 * pixel of height to the page.
 *
 * When a session nobody has on screen comes to need its person, or finishes,
 * the server raises a notice and ONE framed page passes it to the host, in
 * the protocol's own format, for whatever on the canvas shows such lines.
 * The line names the session and its place in words. Pressing it goes
 * nowhere: the format carries an epic and no place, and a line on somebody
 * else's panel is not this module's to make pressable.
 *
 * The connected conversations are declared for the container's header as a
 * View switch, with "Make this the kehikko's own" and "Disconnect from this
 * kehikko" beside it (`viewHeader` in view/conversations.ts).
 *
 * ## When a conversation is connected from inside it
 *
 * `$kehikot-here`, typed in a conversation, writes the record and tells every
 * page following the project which place it went to (the feed's `sessions`
 * event). The page on that place reads its list again — so the bar goes —
 * and puts that conversation on screen (`switchTo`).
