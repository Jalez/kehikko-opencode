/**
 * The sessions that are running, and the socket a page watches one through.
 *
 * ## What is different from Terminal, and it is the point of this file
 *
 * In `kehikko-terminal` a shell lives exactly as long as its socket: the page
 * closes, the socket closes, the pty is killed. That is right for a shell and
 * wrong here. What runs in this pty is an agent that may be twenty minutes
 * into something, and a page reload — which the plumbing does by itself when
 * it finds the page older than its server, and Vite's client does on its own
 * — would end it mid-edit.
 *
 * So a session is owned by THIS PROCESS, not by a socket. A socket is a
 * viewer: it attaches, is sent the screen as it stands, then follows along,
 * and when it goes away nothing else happens. The screen it is sent comes
 * from a second emulator kept here, headless, fed every byte the pty
 * produces — the same arrangement a code editor uses to bring a terminal back
 * after its window reloads. A viewer that returns sees what it would have
 * seen had it never left.
 *
 * A session ends when the program in it exits, when a person ends it from the
 * list, or when this process stops. Never merely because nobody is looking:
 * an agent at work is left to finish.
 *
 * ## There is no limit, and nothing is ever refused for room
 *
 * A place has its session, and going to the place opens it — every time,
 * however many others are running. There used to be a bound here (six), and
 * at it every open was refused and the person was shown a list and asked to
 * end something. Nobody had asked for that, and it locked a person out of
 * their own work: the app does not make a person do its housekeeping. So
 * there is no count anywhere in this file, and no open is refused because of
 * what else is running.
 *
 * What keeps the number of processes down is quiet, and is not a person's
 * business. Two things are ended without anybody choosing, and neither loses
 * anything:
 *
 *  - what was never a session — opened by looking at a place, never typed
 *    into, never recorded — a moment after nobody is looking
 *    (`UNTOUCHED_GRACE`);
 *  - a session nobody is looking at that has been done with its turn for a
 *    long time (`QUIET_REST`). It is a process put away, not a conversation:
 *    a session is resumable by id, and the next visit to its place starts
 *    the program again on the same one, without a question and without a
 *    message.
 *
 * Never one somebody has on screen, never one that is working, and never one
 * that is waiting for an answer.
 *
 * ## Told, not read
 *
 * Whether a session is working, waiting for the person or done with its turn
 * is something the program SAYS (`reports` in program.ts): at each of those
 * moments it runs `tell.sh`, which posts one word to this process over
 * loopback. Nothing here reads a screen to guess at it.
 *
 * What stands behind that word:
 *
 *  - **A secret per run**, minted here when the pty is started and handed to
 *    it in the environment — never on a command line, never in a file. A
 *    report is taken only when it names a running session AND carries that
 *    session's own secret. Everything the program starts inherits the
 *    environment, so the agent in the pty and whatever a project's own hooks
 *    run can read it: the most either can do with it is misstate the state of
 *    the one session they are already inside. It cannot speak for another
 *    session, and it opens no other door — it is not the page's ticket.
 *  - **Only an event's name is heard.** A name this program does not use is
 *    dropped. Nothing a report carries is stored, shown or logged, so a
 *    report cannot put a sentence in front of a person.
 *  - **A report cannot ask for anything.** The most a false one does is move
 *    a dot, send one notice about its own session, or keep its own process
 *    from being put away. Notices are rationed (`NOTICES_AT_ONCE`), so it cannot
 *    fill a panel either.
 *
 * Two things the program does not report are covered from this side, and
 * both are in `program.ts` at length: a person typing into a session that
 * was waiting for them has answered it, and a session called working that
 * has printed nothing for minutes is not (`STALE_WORK`).
 *
 * A program too old to report, or one whose reports never arrive, has no
 * state. Everything else is as it was, including the rule that used to be
 * the only one: put away after a long silence.
 *
 * When this process stops, what stops with it is the pty of each run, and the
 * Codex process in it: a session's hooks and doors are per-run settings, and
 * Codex runs a session with per-run settings in its own process rather than on
 * its shared background server (see `fresh` in program.ts). The next open of
 * the place resumes it by id. What a restart cut off mid-turn is looked for
 * when a project is first named (`recover`).
 *
 * ## A conversation that is already open somewhere else
 *
 * A session this process started is found in `runs`, and a second viewer is
 * put on it. One it did NOT start — open in another terminal, an editor, the
 * Codex app — is asked about before every resume (`active` in program.ts:
 * which process holds the conversation's lock file). Open elsewhere, nothing
 * is started and the page asks; only a person's "open it here anyway" resumes
 * it, and Codex itself then says the conversation is open in another app and
 * offers to retry or fork it. When the program cannot be asked, it is resumed
 * as before, and that is SAID. Nothing here stops, signals or takes over a
 * process this module did not start.
 *
 * ## The fence
 *
 * Unchanged from Terminal, whose `shell.ts` argues it at length: loopback
 * bind, `Origin` and `Host` checked on the upgrade, and the ticket this
 * process printed into its own page carried in the socket's first frame, with
 * nothing started until that frame has been read. It keeps other pages out.
 * It does not keep out a program already running as this user, which could
 * run `codex` itself without asking.
 *
 * What a socket can ask for is narrower than there: not a shell, but this one
 * program, in a folder that exists, on a session id this module minted or the
 * program already holds for that folder — and, once, the vendor's installer
 * when the program is missing. No argument arrives over the wire.

 *
 * There the time is counted from the last byte the program printed, the last
 * thing a person typed, or the moment the last person looked away —
 * whichever is latest. It is the weaker rule and it is known to be: a
 * question left on screen is as silent as a prompt, and under this rule is
 * put away with it. That is what being told is for.
 *
 * What is put away is the process. The conversation is the program's record,
