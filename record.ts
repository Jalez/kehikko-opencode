 *     }
 *
 * ## What is in it, and why each thing
 *
 * - **The key** is `placeKey`: ids only, parts sorted, the kehikko by its
 *   stable `key`. It is what is looked up.
 * - **The names beside it** (`epic`, `parts`, the kehikko's `name`) are for a
 *   person reading the file and for the list an agent is given. Never compared
 *   — with the one exception of `rekey` below, which reads a kehikko's name
 *   once, to bring an older file across.
 * - **The kehikko's `id`** beside a `key` is the row number the host last
 *   called it by: a note for a person lining this file up with a host's
 *   database, nothing more. It is never compared and never looked up.
 * - **A session's `label` and `lastActive`** are what Codex's own record
 *   said the last time this module looked, so the list can be drawn from this
 *   file alone — for a session whose transcript has since been cleaned away,
 *   and for an agent asking through the MCP door.
 *
 * A session may be listed under several places: attaching one to a second
 * place does not take it from the first.
 *
 * ## What is NOT in it
 *
 * A session that does not exist. An id is written here once the program has a
 * record for it and not before — a session that was opened, shown a sign-in
 * screen, and closed again was never a session, and a record of it would be a
 * row that can never be resumed. Until then it is held in memory by `live.ts`.
 * And nothing of a transcript beyond the one line used as a label.
 *
 * ## A part or a kehikko that is deleted
 *
 * Its key can no longer be reached, because the host will never name that
 * combination again. Nothing is deleted on that account: the entry stays in
 * the file, readable, and its sessions stay in Codex's own records for
 * the folder — which is where "attach an existing session" lists them from,
 * for every other place in the project. A rename changes nothing at all, since
 * a rename does not change a key.
 *
 * ## The kehikko by its key, and files written before there was one
 *
 * A host renumbers a kehikko whenever its project is removed and added again,
 * and numbers it afresh on another machine: the `id` in `context.kehikko` is
 * a row in that host's database. Protocol 1.1.0 carries the kehikko's `key`
 * beside it — the one the host keeps in the project's own
 * `.kehikot/host/kehikot.json` (`.kehikot/kehikko/` before protocol 2.2.0) — and that is what a place is filed under
 * (`kehikko=key:4072c9e5`). A host that sends no key leaves the id, and a
 * place filed under it (`kehikko=3`) is as fragile as it always was.
 *
 * Entries written under an id are brought across by `rekey`, once, the first
 * time a host names a kehikko by key: see there for the rule, which matches
 * by the kehikko's NAME because that is the only thing in an old entry that
 * still means what it meant. Reading never does this. `readPlaces` returns
 * what the file says; only `rekey` moves an entry, and it is a write like any
 * other.
 *
 * ## What travels with the project, and what does not
 *
 * This file is in the project, and the sessions it names are not: a session
 * is a transcript in Codex's own folder on the computer where it ran.
 * On another computer — or on this one, after Codex has cleaned an old
 * transcript away — the file names a session there is no record of. Such an
 * id is never removed here on that account (the other computer still has
 * it), and never started: `doors.ts` marks it `missing`, the list shows it
 * muted, and `live.ts` refuses to open it rather than start a new
 * conversation under an old one's id.
 *
 * Because it means so little elsewhere, and holds the first line of what
 * somebody asked, the file is NOT shared by default: the first write puts a
 * `.gitignore` beside it naming it, the way the host does for its tracker
 * reading in its own folder (`.kehikot/host/`, `.kehikot/kehikko/` before protocol 2.2.0). Written only when there is none, so a
 * person who empties it to share the file is not overruled.
 *
 * ## One writer at a time, with nothing awaited in the middle
 *
 * Every change is read-modify-write, and every one of them is synchronous
 * from the read to the rename. That is the whole of the locking: this server
 * is one process on one thread, so two writes cannot interleave unless one of
 * them yields between reading the file and writing it back — and a write that
 * did would put back a copy missing whatever the other had added. So nothing
 * here is `async`, and the test that fires many writes at once is the one to
 * keep green if that ever changes.
 *
 * There is no default project. With no `projectPath` every read is empty and
 * every write refused: a guessed folder is one where work is written and
 * never seen again. Both sides are realpath'd before the containment check,
 * so a `.kehikot` that is a symlink out of the project is refused rather than
 * followed.
