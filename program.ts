/**
 * The program this module opens, and everything that is specific to it.
 *
 * ## This is the only file that knows it is Codex
 *
 * The rest of the module is a terminal that holds one session per place: a pty, a record of
 * which session belongs where, a list to choose from. Everything that knows the program is the
 * Codex CLI is here, as one value of one interface — `Program`, the same interface the Claude
 * module answers for Claude Code.
 *
 * What a program has to answer, and it is the whole list:
 *
 *  1. **Where is the binary?** (`find`) The desktop app starts modules with a thin PATH.
 *  2. **Can this copy do what is asked of it?** (`supports`)
 *  3. **How is a new session started, and how is one resumed?** (`fresh`, `resume`) As argv.
 *  4. **Does a session exist yet, and under which id?** (`settled`) Codex chooses a new
 *     session's id itself and writes nothing for it until the person first says something; the
 *     session's own hooks then name it (`learnSession`).
 *  5. **Which sessions does it hold for a folder?** (`sessions`)
 *  6. **How is it installed?** (`install`)
 *  7. **Can it say what it is doing?** (`hookArgs`, `signal`) Codex's own lifecycle hooks.
 *  8. **Is a session already open in another process?** (`active`) Codex holds a lock file per
 *     conversation while a process writes it; who holds it is asked of `lsof`.
 *
 * ## What is never here
 *
 * A prompt of anybody's but the person's: the person types. The one sentence this module ever
 * sends is its own, fixed, to a conversation a restart cut off mid-turn, when the person opens it
 * again, behind a setting they can turn off (`RESUME_LINE` in live.ts). And no flag that widens
 * what the program may do: nothing about the sandbox, approvals, the model or features. A session
 * opened here has exactly the permissions `codex` would have in any terminal in that folder.
 *
 * ## Every command line this module ever runs, and it is the whole list
 *
 *     codex --help                                     once per binary: which flags and commands it has
 *     codex features list                              once per binary: whether its hooks are on
 *     codex [-c <hook>…] [-c <door>…]                  a new session
 *     codex resume <uuid> [<line>] [-c <hook>…] [-c <door>…]   a session nothing else holds
 *     lsof -F pn <lock files>                          which process holds which conversation: reads
 *
 * `-c` is Codex's own per-run override of its configuration (`config.toml` is never written):
 * `hooks.<Event>` are this module's hooks, `hooks.state` the trust of exactly those hooks, and
 * `mcp_servers.<name>` the Kehikot doors of the place. Measured on 0.164.0 with a scratch
 * `CODEX_HOME` and a stand-in for the model API.
