/**
 * The skills a Codex session started here is given, in Codex's own format.
 *
 * ## Codex's skills, as found (0.164.0, its docs and its source)
 *
 * A Codex skill is the same thing as a Claude Code one: a folder with a `SKILL.md` whose front
 * matter has `name` and `description` (the open agent skills format), optionally
 * `agents/openai.yaml` (`policy.allow_implicit_invocation: false` keeps the model from using it
 * unasked). Codex lists every skill it finds — name, description and the file's path — in a
 * `<skills_instructions>` block it gives the model, which opens the SKILL.md when the person names
 * the skill (`$name`) or the task matches. It finds them in `$CODEX_HOME/skills`, `~/.agents/skills`,
 * the project's `.agents/skills` up to its root, `/etc/codex/skills`, installed plugins and its own
 * bundled ones — and in no folder given for one process: there is no `--plugin-dir`, and
 * `skills.config` only turns a skill it already found on or off.
 *
 * ## So, installed where Codex reads them, and switched off where they do not belong
 *
 * Measured on 0.164.0 against a scratch `CODEX_HOME`: Codex lists a skill in its `$` menu, and runs
 * `$name`, only for a skill it found itself. So the skills a session is given are installed in
 * `~/.agents/skills` (agentSkills.ts), the user-wide folder that is not Codex's own configuration,
 * before the session starts, and held by it until it ends. `skills.config` from `-c` is ADDED to the
 * person's own entries (`[[skills.config]]` in their config.toml stays), and switches a skill off by
 * its path for that one process — a path not there yet included — so every Kehikot install a
 * session is not given is off in it (`disabled`, `disabledArgs`). Codex reads the list when the
 * session starts; a skill installed later does not appear in a running one.
 *
 * The session is still told its skills at its start (`skillsText`, said by context.ts through its
 * SessionStart hook): each as a `$name` it can call, and what was not installed and why.
 *
 * ## Which skills
 *
 * This module's own (`kehikot-here`), every skill of every module on the session's kehikko (those
 * whose door the host gave it), read at that module's origin, and the skills the host keeps for
 * every conversation (`everywhere`, protocol 2.23.0: Kehikot's own `kehikot-module` and every
 * module's, when the person's Settings say "Install every module's skills"). A kehikko-bound skill
 * (protocol 2.12.0, `needs`) only when every need is met by a module on the kehikko — judged on
 * their manifests (protocol 2.21.0), so a need for "a module that keeps an epic's steps" is met by
 * whichever does. A name a skill of the person's already has (`~/.agents/skills/<name>` without
 * Kehikot's marker, or `$CODEX_HOME/skills/<name>`) is not installed.
 *
 * ## Written for Claude Code, given to Codex
 *
 * The modules' skills are written for Claude Code, which fills some things in when a skill loads
 * that Codex does not (`forCodex`): `${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}` becomes `$CODEX_THREAD_ID`, which Codex
 * sets for every command it runs (measured); a `` !`command` `` line, which Claude Code runs
 * before the model reads the skill, becomes an instruction to run that command first — asking to
 * run it outside the sandbox, which blocks loopback (measured: `curl 127.0.0.1` fails inside it);
 * `$ARGUMENTS` is said to be what the person typed after the skill's name; `/name` is `$name`;
 * Claude Code's own front matter (`allowed-tools`, `argument-hint`, …) goes, and
 * `disable-model-invocation: true` becomes `allow_implicit_invocation: false`.
