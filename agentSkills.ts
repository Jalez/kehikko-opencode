/**
 * Kehikot's skills, installed where Codex reads them: `~/.agents/skills/<name>/`.
 *
 * ## Why there, and why this module
 *
 * Codex has no skills folder for one process (no `--plugin-dir`; `skills.config` only turns a
 * skill it already found on or off). It reads `$CODEX_HOME/skills` (deprecated, and `~/.codex` is
 * never written here), `~/.agents/skills`, the repository's `.agents/skills`, `/etc/codex/skills`
 * and plugins. `~/.agents/skills` is the user-wide folder that is not Codex's own configuration, so
 * a skill put there is in Codex's `$` menu and can be invoked. This module puts them there itself
 * (protocol 2.23.0, `declares.agentSessions.installsSkills`): it has the translation from Claude
 * Code's skill syntax (`forCodex` in skills.ts), and the host routes the kehikko's skills to it.
 *
 * ## Whose a folder is
 *
 * The same rules as the host's install into `~/.claude/skills`:
 *
 * - **Only a folder carrying this module's marker** (`MARKER`, `by: 'kehikot.codex'`) is ever
 *   written or removed. Anything else under a name — a skill the person made, one another program
 *   put there, one with a host's marker — is the person's: a skill of Kehikot's by that name is not
 *   installed, and the session is told why (`taken`).
 * - **A folder the person changed** (a file's text is not what was written, or a file was added)
 *   is never overwritten or removed (`edited`).
 * - **Versioned by content**: the marker records the sha256 of every file written, and the version
 *   is the first twelve hex digits over all of them. A different text replaces an untouched install.
 * - **Removed when no longer offered.** Each install says why it is there: the conversations that
 *   hold it (`holders`: a session's folder and this process's pid, alive while both are), and
 *   whether the host keeps it for every conversation (`everywhere`, from its Settings). One that
 *   neither holds is removed.
 *
 * ## Kehikko-bound skills
 *
 * A skill that needs other modules on its kehikko (protocol 2.12.0) is installed only while a
 * conversation whose kehikko meets those needs holds it, and removed when the last one ends. While
 * it is there, every other Codex conversation started here is given it switched OFF for that one
 * process (`-c skills.config=[{path=…, enabled=false}]`, `disabledArgs`): the leak that is left is a
 * Codex conversation started outside Kehikot in that window, and the skill's own text checks its
 * place first (`guarded` in skills.ts).
 *
 * Every function here is synchronous, so that two sessions starting in one process never interleave.
